# BlockTheMob
A tool to identify and list the perennial outraged accounts in social media, and automatically block them from seeing the user posts, preventing future damage.

## Motivation
There is a minority of social media users that, not willing to have a civilized conversation, prefer to interpret others statements in the worst light possible, not giving the benefit of the doubt. They proceed to post hateful, fallacious or otherwise overtly negative content, call out other social media users to join in on the "virtual beating", sometimes reporting the original post to social media moderators to silence the author. Whatever their reasons and motivations, this "digital world" problem has become a real-world one, where these reactions have brought phisical harrasment, death threats, jobs lost, etc.

Now, when social media platforms have tried to avoid these situations, it has resulted in silencing potentially mob-inciting speech, instead of blocking these mobs from happening.

This project is intended as a tool to ease the user social media life, present and future, by searching and listing for usernames belonging to accounts that seem to find outrage and mobcreation as a sport. You don't need to be an influencer to use it, when this project is mature, you should be able to run this program and block the uncivilized even if you don't know them, or have never interacted with them at all. This way, when your social following will grow, or if you post a tweet that happens to go viral, you'll have a higher chance of avoiding the ire of the keyboard warrior. Peaceful replies, peaceful life.

## Development
This project will be based on Python (most of the best NLP and data science libraries are made for it)

## Roadmap
1- Data gathering:
2- Data processing and NLP -> List creation
3- Script to automatically block listed users
4- Public lists of users by topic?
